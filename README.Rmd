This is a practice package for stat 545. 
"foofactors" manipulates factors and makes them easier to deal with. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "README-"
)
library(foofactors)
freq_out(iris$Species)
fbind(iris$Species[c(1, 51, 101)], PlantGrowth$group[c(1, 11, 21)])
```
