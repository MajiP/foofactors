This is a homework package for stat 547. 
"foofactors" manipulates factors and makes them easier to deal with. 
Functions include:
**fbind** to bind two factors together

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(foofactors)
fbind(iris$Species[c(1, 51, 101)], PlantGrowth$group[c(1, 11, 21)])
```

**freq_out** to tabulate a factor

```{r, echo=FALSE}
freq_out(iris$Species)
```

**fctr_or_chr** to determine whether input factor should be a factor or character depending on distinct levels

```{r, echo=TRUE}
fctr_or_chr(iris$Species)
```
